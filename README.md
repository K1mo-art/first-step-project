# K1mo-art: My First Web Project

Welcome to my first web development project!🌐
This respository contains the foundation of a basic website built using HTML and CSS.

## 📄Files in This Project

-'index.html' - Homepage of the website 
-'about.html' - About section
-'links.html' - A page with external or internal links
-'lists.html' - A page demonstrating HTML lists
-'style.css' -  The stylesheet that controls the design of all pages

## 💡 Purpose 

This project is part of my learning journey in front-end development. I created this to:

-Practice basic HTML structure
- Explore CSS styling 
- Understand how multi-page websites work

## 🚀 How to view

You can view the website locally by opening 'index.html' in your browser, or host it using Github pages 

## 🙋🏾‍♀️About me
